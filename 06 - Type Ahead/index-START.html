<!-- 
  
  Learning notes: 
  - The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request â€” as soon as the server responds with headers â€” even if the server response is an HTTP error status.
  - ES6 provides a new operator called spread operator that consists of three dots (...). The spread operator allows you to spread out elements of an iterable object such as an array,a  map, or a set.
